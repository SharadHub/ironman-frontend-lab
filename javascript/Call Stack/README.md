# JavaScript Call Stack

## üìå What is the Call Stack?
The **call stack** is a stack data structure (LIFO ‚Äì Last In, First Out) that JavaScript uses to manage function execution.

- At the very **bottom of the stack**, we always have the **Global Execution Context** (created when the program starts).
- Each time a function is invoked, a new **execution context** is created and pushed onto the stack.
- Once the function finishes, its context is popped off the stack.
- This process ensures JavaScript executes functions in the correct order and keeps track of ‚Äúwhere it is‚Äù in the program.
